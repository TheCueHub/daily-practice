He listened to songs every day. He had a big dream: he wanted to play the guitar. The sound of a guitar was beautiful, he thought.</p><p>One sunny Saturday, Leo went to the shop. He bought a shiny, new guitar. It was a beautiful brown colour. He felt very excited. "Now I can play music!" he said to himself.</p><p>He took the guitar home. He sat on his sofa and held it. It felt big in his hands. He watched some videos online to learn. "Okay," he thought, "first, I need to put my fingers here."</p><p>He pressed his fingers onto the strings. Oh! His fingers felt sore immediately. He tried to make a sound. *Zzzzzzz*. It was not a nice sound. It was a strange noise. Not music.</p><p>Leo tried again. And again. His fingers felt very tired. The sounds were still bad. *Zing! Clunk! Zzzzzzz!* He tried to play a simple song, but it was impossible. He felt frustrated. His dream felt very far away.</p><p>"This is too hard!" he said out loud. He wanted to put the guitar away and never touch it again. He felt a little sad. Learning guitar was much more difficult than he thought.</p><p>A few days later, his neighbour, Maria, saw him. Maria was a kind old woman, and she played the guitar very well. She always had a big smile.</p><p>"Hello, Leo!" she said. "How is your new guitar?"</p><p>Leo sighed. "It's very hard, Maria. My fingers hurt. The sound is bad. I want to stop."</p><p>Maria smiled kindly. "Don't give up, Leo!" she said. "Learning takes time. It's like planting a small seed. You must water it every day, and be patient. You won't see a big tree immediately."</p><p>"But it's so difficult," Leo repeated.</p><p>"Yes, it is difficult at first," Maria agreed. "But listen. Don't practice for a long time. Practice for just 15 minutes every day. Every single day. Your fingers will get stronger. Your ears will hear better. And you will see small progress."</p><p>Leo thought about Maria's words. "Just 15 minutes," he thought. "I can do that."</p><p>So, Leo started again. Every day, after work, he sat down with his guitar for 15 minutes.</p><p>At first, it was still hard. His fingers still felt sore. The sounds were still not perfect. But he didn't stop. He remembered Maria's words: "Be patient."</p><p>After one week, his fingers hurt less. After two weeks, he could make one clear sound. Then two clear sounds. He felt a little bit happy.</p><p>After one month, he could play a simple chord. *Strum!* It was not perfect, but it sounded like music! He smiled.</p><p>Slowly, day by day, his guitar playing got better. He learned new chords. He learned to move his fingers faster.</p><p>One evening, Leo sat with his guitar. He pressed his fingers. He strummed the strings. And a simple tune came out. It was "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star." He played it from beginning to end.</p><p>Leo felt a big smile on his face. He had done it! It was not easy. It took a long time and a lot of practice. But he did not give up.</p><p>Learning a new skill is like climbing a mountain. It can be hard, and you might want to stop. But if you keep trying, step by step, you will reach the top. Leo learned that day that patience and practice make dreams come true. And now, he could make beautiful music.</p>               </div>           </div>            <div class="content-card questions-section">               <div class="questions-content">                   <h2>Leo and the Noisy Guitar Quiz</h2><h3>Five Multiple-Choice Questions</h3><div class="question">1.
