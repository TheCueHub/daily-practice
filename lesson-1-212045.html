He packed his big blue backpack. Inside, he put his clothes, a book, and a photo of his family. He felt a mix of feelings: a little nervous, but mostly very excited. Today, he was going to Riverbend City! It was a very big city, far away from his quiet hometown. He had a new job waiting for him there.</p><p>He walked to the train station. The sun was shining. The station was busy. People were talking, laughing, and waiting. Leo found his train ticket in his pocket. He found his platform and waited. Soon, the long train arrived. It was shiny and fast-looking.</p><p>Leo found his seat next to a big window. He put his backpack on the shelf above. He took a deep breath. The train gave a soft sound, then it slowly started to move. He waved goodbye to his hometown in his mind.</p><p>He looked out the window. At first, he saw green fields and small, red-roofed houses. He saw cows eating grass in the sun. The sky was very blue, with fluffy white clouds. The train moved faster and faster. The world outside became a blur of colours. Leo listened to music through his headphones and dreamed about his new life. He wondered what Riverbend City would be like. Would he make new friends?</p><p>Hours passed. The landscape slowly changed. The fields became fewer. More roads appeared, then more cars. Small towns passed by, with more buildings and busier streets. The sun began to go down, painting the sky orange and pink. Leo ate a snack and watched the lights of different towns turn on.</p><p>Finally, a very big skyline appeared in the distance. Tall buildings, like giants, reached for the sky. Many bright lights twinkled. This was Riverbend City! The train started to slow down, making a loud sound. It entered a huge, busy station. People were standing up, taking their bags.</p><p>Leo took his backpack. His heart beat a little faster. He stepped off the train. The station was full of sounds: announcements, people talking, trains arriving. The air smelled different, like a big city. He followed the crowd outside.</p><p>Wow! Riverbend City was even bigger than he imagined. Very tall buildings stood all around him. Bright signs lit up the night. Taxis rushed past, their yellow lights shining. People walked quickly, laughing and talking.</p><p>Leo felt a little tired, but his smile was big. He took a deep breath of the city air. His memorable journey was over, but a brand new adventure was just beginning. He was ready for Riverbend City.</p></div></div><div class="section questions-section"><div class="section-title"><div class="icon questions-icon">‚ùì</div>Part 2: Questions</div><div class="question-group"><h3>üéØ Multiple-Choice Questions</h3><div class="question"><br></div><div class="question">1.
