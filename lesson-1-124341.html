Her house was near the green fields, and she knew everyone. But one sunny morning, Lena packed her small blue suitcase. She was going on a big trip! She was going to City Central â€“ a very big city she had only seen in pictures.</p><p>Lena felt a mix of feelings. She was a little sad to leave her peaceful town, but mostly, she was excited! This was her first time traveling alone. Her aunt, Maria, lived in City Central, and Lena was going to stay with her for two weeks.</p><p>At the train station, her parents gave her a big hug. "Have a wonderful time, Lena!" her mother said. Lena waved goodbye from the train window as it slowly started to move.</p><p>The train journey was long but interesting. Lena sat by the window and watched the world go by. First, she saw green fields with cows and sheep. Then, small villages with pretty houses appeared. After an hour, the houses became bigger, and there were more of them. The trees were still green, but Lena started to see more roads and cars.</p><p>The landscape changed slowly. Soon, the green fields disappeared completely. Now, Lena saw many tall buildings. The train moved faster and faster through the city suburbs. There were so many cars, so many people! The buildings were close together, touching the sky. Lena's eyes were wide with wonder.</p><p>Finally, the train arrived at City Central station. It was huge! Many people were walking quickly, and there were loud announcements. Lena felt a little lost in the noise and the crowd. She took a deep breath and looked for Aunt Maria.</p><p>Then, Lena saw a friendly face! It was Aunt Maria. Aunt Maria waved and gave Lena a big hug. "Welcome to City Central!" she said. Lena felt warm and safe.</p><p>Aunt Maria took Lena outside the station. The city was amazing! The streets were full of cars and buses. People walked quickly, talking and laughing. Tall buildings touched the sky. Bright lights were everywhere, even in the morning. Lena looked up, up, up!</p><p>"It's so busy!" Lena said, her voice full of excitement.</p><p>Aunt Maria smiled. "Yes, it is. But it's also very beautiful."</p><p>They walked to Aunt Maria's apartment. On the way, they passed a big park with a sparkling fountain. Children were playing, and people were sitting on benches, reading books. Lena loved it.</p><p>That evening, Lena stood by the window in Aunt Maria's apartment. Below, the city lights twinkled like stars. It was so different from her quiet town. It was noisy, fast, and full of energy. Lena smiled. This journey was truly memorable, and her big adventure in City Central was just beginning. She knew she would love her time here.</p>               </div>           </div>            <div class="content-card questions-section">               <div class="questions-content">                   <h2># Multiple-Choice Questions</h2><div class="question">1.
