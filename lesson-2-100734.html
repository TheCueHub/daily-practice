He listened to songs every day. He had a big dream: he wanted to play the guitar. One Saturday, Leo went to a music shop. He chose a guitar. It felt heavy. He bought it and took it home. Leo was very excited. He thought, "This will be easy! Soon I will play my favourite songs."</p><p>Leo opened a book about playing guitar. He tried to hold the guitar. It felt strange. His left hand needed to press strings. His right hand needed to strum. He pressed the strings. His fingers hurt. He tried to make a sound. *Twang! Clunk!* It was not music. It was just noise. Leo felt sad. "This is harder than I thought," he said.</p><p>Every day, Leo practiced. He tried to make different chords. A chord is when you press many strings. But his fingers were weak. The sounds were bad. *Buzz! Squeak!* Sometimes, he felt very frustrated. He saw videos online of people playing guitar well. Leo looked at his guitar. He thought, "My guitar sounds terrible. I will never be good." He felt like giving up. He put the guitar down after ten minutes.</p><p>One evening, Leo sat on his sofa. His guitar was in its case. He did not want to touch it. He thought, "Maybe playing guitar is not for me. Maybe I should stop." He felt sad because he loved music. Then, he remembered his dream. He remembered how happy he was when he bought the guitar. He thought about his favourite song. He wanted to play that song. He opened his eyes. "No," he said, "I will not give up. I will try again."</p><p>The next day, Leo tried a new plan. He did not practice for a long time. He practiced for fifteen minutes, two or three times a day. He focused on just one thing. First, he practiced holding the guitar correctly. Then, he practiced pressing one string for a clear sound. Slowly, his fingers became stronger. They hurt less. The sounds started to get better.</p><p>One afternoon, Leo tried to play a simple chord. He put his fingers in the right places. He strummed the strings. *Ding!* A clear sound! It was a real chord! Leo smiled. He felt so happy. He practiced this chord many times. Then, he learned another one. He learned to change from one chord to another. It was still slow, but it was music! He could play a very simple song. It had only two chords. He felt proud of his progress.</p><p>Weeks passed. Leo kept practicing. Sometimes it was still hard, but he did not give up. His fingers moved more quickly. The sounds were much better. One day, he played his favourite song. He played all the chords correctly. The music filled his room. Leo felt wonderful. He put his guitar down and smiled a big smile. He learned an important lesson: learning a new skill is difficult. It takes time and effort. You will have bad days. But if you keep trying, you can make your dream come true. Now, Leo plays his guitar often. He is happy he did not give up. He knows he can learn anything if he tries.</p>               </div>           </div>            <div class="content-card questions-section">               <div class="questions-content">                   <h3>Five Multiple-Choice Questions</h3><div class="question">1.
