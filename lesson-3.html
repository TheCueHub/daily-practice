Here is a story for an A2 English language learner.</p><p>### My Favorite Birthday</p><p>My name is Marco, and I want to tell you about my favorite childhood memory. It was my seventh birthday. I remember that day very well because it was full of sunshine and surprises.</p><p>I woke up early in the morning. The sun was shining through my window. I jumped out of bed because I was very excited. It was my special day! I ran to the kitchen. The house smelled wonderful. My mother was in the kitchen, and she was baking a cake.</p><p>"Happy birthday, Marco!" she said and gave me a big hug.</p><p>My father was in the garden. He was putting up decorations. There were many colorful balloons. There were red, blue, and yellow balloons. Our garden looked beautiful and festive. I felt so happy.</p><p>In the afternoon, my friends arrived. My best friend, Leo, was there, and my friend Sofia came too. All my cousins were there. We played games in the garden. We played tag, and we played hide-and-seek. Everyone was laughing and running. It was so much fun. My mother made lemonade for us, and we ate sandwiches.</p><p>Later, my mother brought out the birthday cake. It was a big chocolate cake with white frosting. There were seven candles on top, one for every year of my life. Everyone stood around the table and sang "Happy Birthday to You." I felt a little shy but also very proud.</p><p>"Make a wish, Marco!" my father said.</p><p>I closed my eyes. I wished for a new bicycle. I wanted a red bicycle more than anything. Then, I took a big breath and blew out all the candles. Everyone clapped and cheered!</p><p>After we ate the delicious cake, my father said, "Marco, I have a big surprise for you."</p><p>He went into the house and came back with a very big box. The box was wrapped in blue paper with stars on it. I did not know what was inside. My heart was beating fast.</p><p>"Open it!" my friends shouted.</p><p>I slowly opened the box. Inside, I saw something shiny and red. It was a brand new bicycle! It was a beautiful, shiny red bicycle, just like the one I wished for.</p><p>"Wow!" I shouted. "Thank you, thank you!" I hugged my mother and father. It was the best present ever.</p><p>My father helped me take the bicycle into the garden. All my friends wanted to see it. My father held the back of the bike, and I tried to ride it. It was a little difficult at first, and I fell down one time. But I got up and tried again. After a few tries, I could ride it by myself! I rode around the garden, and all my friends cheered for me. I felt like the happiest boy in the world.</p><p>That day was the best day. It wasn't just because of the cake or the new bicycle. It was because all my family and friends were with me. I felt so loved. And I learned to ride my new bike. That is why my seventh birthday is my favorite childhood memory.</p></div></div><div class="section questions-section"><div class="section-title"><div class="icon questions-icon">‚ùì</div>Part 2: Questions</div><div class="question-group"><h3>üéØ Multiple-Choice Questions</h3><div class="question"><br></div><div class="question">1.
