He was going to a new city! His small town was quiet, and he wanted to see something different. He packed his big blue bag carefully. Inside, he put his clothes, a favorite book, and a photo of his family. He felt a little nervous, but mostly he felt very excited. "Goodbye, quiet town!" he thought. "Hello, Brightville!"</p><p>Leo went to the train station. The train was very long and red. He found his seat next to a big window. He put his bag above his head. Slowly, the train started to move. Then it went faster and faster. Leo looked out the window. He saw green fields, tall trees, and small houses. The sky was blue. He ate an apple and listened to music on his small phone. The journey was long, but it was interesting. Every hour, the view changed.</p><p>After many hours, the train started to slow down. "Brightville!" a voice said over the speaker. Leo felt a jump of excitement in his stomach. He got off the train. The station was huge, much bigger than his town's station. Many people were walking quickly, and there was a lot of noise: cars honking, people talking loudly, and music playing from shops. Brightville was very different from his quiet town. It was big, busy, and bright.</p><p>Leo took a taxi to his new apartment. It was a small apartment, but it was clean and had a nice view. There was one bedroom and a small kitchen. He put his bag down. He felt a little tired, but also very happy. He opened the window and looked out. He saw many tall buildings, some with colorful lights. He heard the city sounds outside.</p><p>He decided to explore. He walked out onto the street. The streets were wide, and there were many shops with bright signs. People were laughing and talking everywhere. He saw a beautiful park with big green trees. Children were playing, and old people were sitting on benches. Leo smiled. He found a small cafe and bought a warm hot chocolate. It was very tasty. "This city is big," he thought, "but it feels good." He saw a small, friendly dog and smiled at its owner. He walked more, feeling happy.</p><p>When it got dark, Leo went back to his apartment. He looked out the window again. The city lights were like a million stars on the ground. He felt calm and hopeful. "This is my new home," he thought. His journey was not just to a new place; it was the start of his new life. It was a memorable journey, full of new sights and exciting feelings.</p></div></div><div class="section questions-section"><div class="section-title"><div class="icon questions-icon">‚ùì</div>Part 2: Questions</div><div class="question-group"><h3>üéØ Multiple-Choice Questions</h3><div class="question"><br></div><div class="question">1.
