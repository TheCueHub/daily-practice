The sun was bright, and the sky was blue. It was a perfect day for a journey.</p><p>Lena said goodbye to her family. Then, she walked to the train station. The station was big and busy. Many people were there. The trains were long and shiny. Lena found her train and smiled.</p><p>She found her seat next to a big window. The seat was soft and comfortable. Soon, the train started to move. Slowly at first, then faster and faster. Lena looked out the window.</p><p>She saw green fields and small houses. The trees were tall. Sometimes, she saw rivers shining in the sun. The world outside moved quickly. Lena drank some water and ate an apple. She thought about Riverbend City. What would it be like? Would she make new friends?</p><p>Hours passed. The sun started to go down, painting the sky orange and pink. Lena felt tired but happy. Suddenly, the train slowed down.

The station in Riverbend City was even bigger! There were many, many people.</p><p>She walked out of the station. Riverbend City was amazing! Tall buildings touched the sky. Bright lights shone everywhere. Cars moved in long lines, and people walked fast. The air felt different, fresh and exciting.</p><p>Lena found her new apartment building. It was not too big, but it was nice. Her new apartment was on the third floor. It was small but had a nice big window. From her window, she could see a park with green trees.</p><p>Lena put her bag down. She was tired, but she wanted to see more. She walked outside again. She found a small cafe and bought a warm cup of tea. She sat by the window and watched the city life. People laughed and talked. She felt a warm feeling in her heart.</p><p>This was her new adventure. This was her new home. Lena smiled. Riverbend City was big and busy, but it was also wonderful.
