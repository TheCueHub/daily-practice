She liked her town, but she wanted to see new places. One day, her Aunt Clara invited her to visit. Aunt Clara lived in Greenwood City. It was a very big city. Anna was excited!</p><p>Anna packed her small bag. She put in clothes, her favourite book, and a little camera. She said goodbye to her family. "Have a good trip!" her mother said.</p><p>Anna went to the train station. The train was long and red. She found her seat next to a big window. "Bye, bye!" she waved as the train started to move.</p><p>The train started slowly, then went faster and faster. Anna looked out the window. First, she saw green fields and small farms. Then, she saw small villages with quiet streets. The sky was blue and sunny. Anna felt happy and a little bit nervous. "Greenwood City is so big," she thought.</p><p>After some hours, the view changed. The fields disappeared. Anna saw more houses, then many tall buildings. There were many cars on the roads. The train was slower now. A voice said, "Next stop: Greenwood City!"</p><p>Anna felt her heart beat faster. She stood up and took her bag. The train stopped. Anna got off the train. The station was very big and noisy. Many people were walking quickly.</p><p>"Anna!" a voice called. It was Aunt Clara! She had a big smile. Anna hugged her aunt.</p><p>"Welcome to Greenwood City!" Aunt Clara said.</p><p>Greenwood City was amazing! The buildings were very, very tall. Anna looked up and up. The streets were full of cars and buses. Many people walked everywhere. The lights were very bright, even in the daytime. It was busy, but also very exciting.</p><p>Aunt Clara took Anna to a big, beautiful park. It was called 'Central Park'. There were so many green trees and colourful flowers. Children played, and people sat on benches. In the middle of the park, there was a very old, tall clock tower. It looked like a giant.</p><p>"Wow!" Anna said. She took a photo with her camera. The clock tower was very beautiful and special. This was her first big trip alone, and Greenwood City was wonderful.</p><p>Anna smiled. This journey was truly memorable. She was happy to be here. She knew she would love her time in Greenwood City.</p>               </div>           </div>            <div class="content-card questions-section">               <div class="questions-content">                                  </div>           </div>            <div class="footer">               <p>âœ¨ Keep learning and improving your English every day! âœ¨</p>           </div>       </div>        <script>           function readStoryAloud() {               const button = document.querySelector('.read-aloud-btn');               const storyContent = document.getElementById('story-content');                // Stop any ongoing speech               if (window.speechSynthesis.speaking) {                   window.speechSynthesis.cancel();                   button.innerHTML = '<i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i> Read Story Aloud';                   return;               }                // Extract text content from the story HTML               const textToRead = storyContent.textContent || storyContent.innerText;                if (textToRead.trim() === '') {                   alert('No text content found to read.');                   return;               }                // Create speech synthesis utterance               const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(textToRead);                // Configure speech settings               utterance.rate = 0.8;  // Slightly slower for language learners               utterance.pitch = 1.0;               utterance.volume = 1.0;                // Try to use an English voice if available               const voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices();               const englishVoice = voices.find(voice =>                    voice.lang.includes('en') && voice.name.includes('English')               );               if (englishVoice) {                   utterance.voice = englishVoice;               }                // Update button during speech               button.innerHTML = '<i class="fas fa-stop"></i> Stop Reading';                // Handle speech events               utterance.onend = function() {                   button.innerHTML = '<i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i> Read Story Aloud';               };                utterance.onerror = function(event) {                   console.error('Speech synthesis error:', event.error);                   button.innerHTML = '<i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i> Read Story Aloud';                   alert('Sorry, there was an error with the text-to-speech feature.');               };                // Start speaking               window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);           }            // Load voices when they become available           window.speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged = function() {               // Voices are now loaded           };            // Add smooth scrolling for mobile           document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#"]').forEach(anchor => {               anchor.addEventListener('click', function (e) {                   e.preventDefault();                   document.querySelector(this.getAttribute('href')).scrollIntoView({                       behavior: 'smooth'                   });               });           });       </script>   </body>   </html>
