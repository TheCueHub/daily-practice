For me, it is a very special day with my Grandpa. I was about six or seven years old. We lived in a small town. Next to our house, there was a big green park. This park was my favourite place to play. It had tall trees, a small lake, and lots of open space. This memory always makes me smile.</p><p>It was a sunny Saturday morning. The sky was very blue, and there were only a few white clouds. It was not too hot, and there was a light wind. Grandpa came to my house early. He had a big smile on his face. In his hand, he carried something long and thin, wrapped in paper. I was very curious. "Good morning, Leo!" he said. "Are you ready for an adventure?" I nodded my head quickly.</p><p>Grandpa unwrapped the paper. Inside, there was a beautiful, bright red kite! It was new and shiny. It had a long tail with colourful ribbons. "Wow!" I said. I had never flown a kite before. Grandpa explained, "Today, we will make this kite fly high in the sky. We need the wind to help us." My heart felt very happy and excited.</p><p>We walked to the park. We found a very open area, far from the trees. Grandpa took the kite out of its bag. He showed me how to hold it. "You hold it like this," he said, "and when I say 'run,' you run fast!" He held the string firmly. The wind was blowing gently now. I held the kite, feeling it pull a little in my hands.</p><p>"Ready?" Grandpa asked. "Run, Leo, run!" I started to run as fast as my small legs could go. I ran across the green grass. The kite wobbled behind me. It went up a little, then fell down again. "Try again!" Grandpa called. We tried a few times. It was a little difficult. But Grandpa was patient. He laughed and helped me. He said, "Don't give up! We can do it!"</p><p>Then, on the fifth try, something amazing happened. I ran, and Grandpa let out the string. The kite lifted into the air! It flew higher and higher. It danced in the blue sky. It looked like a big red bird. I stopped running and looked up. My mouth opened wide. It was so beautiful! Grandpa held the string, and I held his hand. We both watched the kite.</p><p>We sat on the soft grass. The sun was warm on our faces. We watched the red kite fly for a long time. It went up, then down, then up again. The ribbons on its tail fluttered in the wind. We could hear the sound of the wind, like a soft whisper. Grandpa told me a  story about flying kites when he was a boy. His voice was calm and kind. I felt very safe and happy next to him.</p><p>After a long time, the sun started to go down. The sky changed from blue to orange and pink. It was time to go home. Grandpa slowly pulled the string, and the red kite came down to us. We folded it carefully. We walked home, holding hands. I was a little tired, but my heart was full of joy.</p><p>That day was not just about flying a kite. It was about spending time with my Grandpa. It was about his patience and his smile. It was about learning something new and feeling so happy. Even today, when I see a kite in the sky, I remember that day. I remember the bright red kite, the blue sky, and my loving Grandpa. It is my favorite memory because it fills my heart with warmth and love.</p></div></div><div class="section questions-section"><div class="section-title"><div class="icon questions-icon">‚ùì</div>Part 2: Questions</div><div class="question-group"><h3>üéØ Multiple-Choice Questions</h3><div class="question"><br></div><div class="question">1.
