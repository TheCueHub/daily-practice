He especially loved pictures of animals. One day, he saw a beautiful drawing of a cat. The cat in the picture looked very real. Its fur looked soft, and its eyes looked bright.</p><p>"Wow!" thought Leo. "I want to draw like that!"</p><p>Leo went to the shop. He bought a new drawing book and some colourful pencils. He felt very excited. He couldn't wait to start.</p><p>When Leo got home, he opened his new book. He found a clean page. He picked up a pencil. "Okay," he said, "I will draw a cat."</p><p>He started to draw. First, he drew a big circle for the cat's head. Then, he added two triangles for the ears. He drew a long body. He drew four legs and a tail. He tried to draw the cat's eyes, nose, and mouth.</p><p>When he finished, Leo looked at his drawing. His smile disappeared. The cat did not look like a real cat. It looked like a big, messy potato with legs! The ears were too big. The tail was too short. The eyes were not bright; they looked like two small dots.</p><p>Leo felt sad. "This is too difficult," he thought. "I can't draw." He put his pencil down. He felt like giving up.</p><p>The next day, Leo looked at the cat drawing again. He still wanted to draw well. But how? He remembered his art teacher once said, "Learning new things takes time. Don't give up quickly!"</p><p>So, Leo decided to try again. This time, he did not start with a whole cat. He found a video online. It was a simple drawing lesson. The video showed how to draw one eye of a cat.</p><p>Leo watched carefully. He picked up his pencil. He drew lines slowly. He drew one small oval. Then, he drew a smaller circle inside. He added a tiny dot. He drew some lines for the fur around the eye.</p><p>It was hard. His hand felt tired. But he kept trying. He drew one eye, then another, then another. After many tries, he drew an eye that looked good. It looked like a real cat's eye!</p><p>Leo felt a little happy. "Okay," he thought, "maybe I can do this."</p><p>Next, he practiced drawing ears. He drew many ears ‚Äì big ears, small ears, pointy ears, round ears. Then, he practiced paws. He drew many paws.</p><p>He spent many days practicing small parts of the cat. He drew eyes, ears, noses, and paws. His paper was full of small drawings. Some were bad, but many were much better.</p><p>After a week, Leo felt ready. He opened a new page in his book. He took a deep breath. "Now," he said, "I will draw a whole cat."</p><p>He started slowly. He thought about the shapes for the head and body. He drew the ears carefully. He remembered how to draw the eyes from the video. He added the nose, mouth, and whiskers. He drew the legs and tail.</p><p>When he finished, Leo looked at his drawing. It was not perfect. It was not like the beautiful picture he saw in the shop. But it was his cat. And it looked like a cat! The eyes looked much better. The fur looked a little soft. It was a good cat!</p><p>Leo smiled. He felt very proud. He understood something important. Learning a new skill is a challenge. It takes time. It takes practice. And it is okay if the first try is not perfect. The most important thing is not to give up.</p><p>Leo kept drawing. Every day, his cats became a little better. He was happy to be a drawing artist, one line at a time.</p></div></div><div class="section questions-section"><div class="section-title"><div class="icon questions-icon">‚ùì</div>Part 2: Questions</div><div class="question-group"><h3>üéØ Multiple-Choice Questions</h3><div class="question"><br></div><div class="question">1.
