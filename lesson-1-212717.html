Every day was the same: the same small shops, the same friendly faces, the same green park. But Lena wanted something new. She wanted a big adventure! So, she found a job in Silver City. It was a very big city, far away. Lena felt a little nervous, but mostly she felt very, very excited.</p><p>One sunny morning, Lena woke up early. Her small suitcase was ready. She ate a quick breakfast and went to the train station. Her family was there to say goodbye. "Be brave, Lena!" her mother said. Lena gave big hugs and then got on the train. She found a window seat and put her bag on the rack above. The train started to move slowly, then faster and faster.</p><p>Lena looked out the window. She saw green fields and happy cows. She saw small, quiet villages with old stone houses. The train made a calming "chug-chug" sound. For many hours, the world outside changed. The green fields slowly turned into more houses, then bigger buildings. The sky started to turn orange and pink as the sun began to set.</p><p>Then, the train began to slow down. Lena‚Äôs heart beat a little faster. She saw the first very tall buildings. They touched the clouds! "Wow!" Lena whispered. The train stopped at a huge station. There were so many people! The station was loud with announcements, people talking, and the sounds of other trains. Lena took a deep breath. She felt very small in this big place.</p><p>She got off the train and walked with the crowd. The air felt different here ‚Äì busy and full of energy. She saw bright lights everywhere, even though it was still daytime. Outside the station, Lena took a taxi to her new apartment. The streets were like rivers of cars and buses. She saw thousands of bright shop windows, huge screens with moving pictures, and people, people, people! They walked fast, talked fast, and laughed loud.</p><p>The taxi stopped in front of a very tall building. "This is it!" the driver said. Lena paid him and carried her suitcase inside. Her apartment was small but bright and clean. She put her bags down and walked to the window. It was dark outside now, and the city lights were amazing. They sparkled like a million tiny stars on the ground. She could see far, far away.</p><p>Lena felt tired from the long journey, but her heart was full of happiness. She was not in her quiet town anymore. She was in Silver City, her new home. The journey was long, exciting, and a little bit scary, but it was truly memorable. Lena smiled. Her new life, her big adventure, started right here, right now.</p></div></div><div class="section questions-section"><div class="section-title"><div class="icon questions-icon">‚ùì</div>Part 2: Questions</div><div class="question-group"><h3>‚úè Sentence Completion</h3><div class="question"><br></div><div class="question">1.
